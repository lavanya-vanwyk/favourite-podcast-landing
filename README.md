# "My Favourite Podcast" Landing Page

This landing page was made as a submission for a voluntary monthly challenge for SheCodes students.


## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build an engaging and lively webpage. I aimed to achieve this by incorporating a hero header that responds to user mouse-over action, and added animated hyperlinked headings and social buttons

This project received an honorable mention at the end of monthly challenge, with nearly 100 community votes.

### A massive vote of thanks to SheCodes for providing me with this amazing learning opportunity.
