## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build an engaging and lively webpage. I aimed to achieve this by incorporating a hero header that responds to user mouse-over action, and added animated hyperlinked headings and social buttons

### A massive vote of thanks to SheCodes for providing me with this amazing learning opportunity.
